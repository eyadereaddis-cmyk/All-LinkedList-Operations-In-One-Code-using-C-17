# Linked List Playground in Modern C++

An **interactive C++ demo program** that showcases all the classic linked list data structures:

- ✅ Singly Linked List (with `unique_ptr`)
- ✅ Doubly Linked List (with raw pointers)
- ✅ Circular Linked List (with raw pointers)
- ✅ STL `forward_list` (singly)
- ✅ STL `list` (doubly)

This project is designed for **students, interview preparation, and C++ learners** who want to see how linked lists work in practice.
